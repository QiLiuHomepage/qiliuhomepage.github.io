I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. [Hiroya Nakao](http://www.k.mei.titech.ac.jp/members_personal/nakao/index-e.html) at Department of Systems and Control Engineering, School of Engineering, [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/), Japan. My research interest includes applied mathematics, nonlinear dynamics especially stochastic dynamics, random vibration and control, as well as their applications in various areas of engineering and applied science.

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2016. Then, I received a Ph.D degree in Mathematics from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021.

You can find my CV here: [Qi Liu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
