I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher working with [Prof. Hiroya Nakao](http://www.k.mei.titech.ac.jp/members_personal/nakao/index-e.html) at [Nakao-Lab](http://www.k.mei.titech.ac.jp/), Department of Systems and Control Engineering, School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. My research interest includes applied mathematics, nonlinear dynamics, stochastic dynamics, random vibration and control, as well as their applications in various areas of engineering and applied science.

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2016. Then, I received a Ph.D degree in Mathematics, advised by Prof. Yong Xu, from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021.
