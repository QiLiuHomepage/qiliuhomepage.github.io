Thank you for visiting my homepage!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher working with [Prof. Hiroya Nakao](http://www.k.mei.titech.ac.jp/members_personal/nakao/index-e.html) at the [Nakao-Lab](http://www.k.mei.titech.ac.jp/), Department of Systems and Control Engineering, School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2016. Then, I received my Ph.D degree in Mathematics, advised by [Prof. Yong Xu](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/xuyong.html), from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021.

My research interest includes applied mathematics, nonlinear dynamics, stochastic dynamics, random vibration and control, as well as their applications in various areas of engineering and applied science.

You can find my CV here: [Qi Liu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
