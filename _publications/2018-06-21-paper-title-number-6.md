excerpt: 'Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the active vibration suppression of a fractional two-degree-of-freedom viscoelastic airfoil (TDOFVA) model with a harmonic external force by means of the sliding mode control (SMC) scheme. The viscoelastic behavior is described as a fractional-order derivative, leading to a new fractional TDOFVA model. Subsequently, an averaging technique is extended to derive the amplitude-frequency relations, and its correctness is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, effects of the system parameters on the dynamics are explored. To achieve a vibration suppression, we convert the TDOFVA system into a series of fractional-order differential equations. Then, a SMC strategy is employed, in which a fractional-order integral sliding surface is presented and asymptotical stability analysis of the SMC is performed. Several numerical results are presented to illustrate the performances of the proposed SMC scheme, which indicate that the given SMC methodology is effective to realize a vibration suppression of the TDOFVA model.'
