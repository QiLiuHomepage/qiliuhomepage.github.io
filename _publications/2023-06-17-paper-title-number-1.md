excerpt: 'Abstract: An aircraft in practice serves under extreme flight conditions that will have a substantial impact on its flight safety. Understanding dynamics of airfoil structure of an aircraft subjected to severe load conditions is thus extremely valuable and necessary. In this study, we will explore the complicated dynamical behaviors of a conceptual airfoil excited by an external harmonic force and an extreme random load. Importantly, such an extreme random load is portrayed by a non-Gaussian Lévy noise with a heavy-tailed feature. Bistable behaviors of the deterministic airfoil system are performed firstly from amplitude–frequency response and basin of attraction. Then, the effects of the extreme random load on the airfoil system are thoroughly investigated. Interestingly, within the bistable regime, the extreme random load can lead to stochastic transition and stochastic resonance. Due to its heavy-tailed nature, the Lévy noise would increase the possibility of a highly unexpected stochastic transition behavior between desirable low-amplitude and catastrophic high-amplitude oscillations compared with the Gaussian scenario. Such vibration patterns might damage or destroy the airfoil structure, which will put an aircraft in great danger. All the findings would be helpful in ensuring the flight safety and enhancing the strength and reliability of airfoil structure operating at extreme flight conditions.'
