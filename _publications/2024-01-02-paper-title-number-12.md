excerpt: 'Abstract: The occurrence mechanisms of extreme events under random disturbances are relatively complex and not yet clear. In this paper, we take a class of generalized Duffing-type systems as an example to reveal three mechanisms for the occurrence of extreme events. First, it is intuitive that a very large excitation can generate extreme events, such as the LÃ©vy noise. In such a case, extreme excitation works, while it does not require much about the systems. Second, when a system has a bifurcation structure, if the difference of the branches at the bifurcation point is large, a randomly varying bifurcation parameter can lead to extreme events. Finally, when a system has rare attractors, a random impulse excitation, such as Poisson white noise, is able to cause the system to escape from one general attractor into rare attractors. Such a kind of special regime switching behavior can lead to extreme events. These results reveal the possible mechanisms of extreme events in a class of nonlinear Duffing-type systems and provide guidance for further prediction and avoidance of extreme events.'
