excerpt: 'Abstract: The occurrence mechanisms of extreme events under random disturbances are relatively complex and not yet clear. In this paper, we take a class of generalized Duffing-type systems as an example to reveal three mechanisms for the occurrence of extreme events. First, it is intuitive that a very large excitation can generate extreme events, such as the Lévy noise. In such a case, extreme excitation works, while it does not require much about the systems. Second, when a system has a bifurcation structure, if the difference of the branches at the bifurcation point is large, a randomly varying bifurcation parameter can lead to extreme events. Finally, when a system has rare attractors, a random impulse excitation, such as Poisson white noise, is able to cause the system to escape from one general attractor into rare attractors. Such a kind of special regime switching behavior can lead to extreme events. These results reveal the possible mechanisms of extreme events in a class of nonlinear Duffing-type systems and provide guidance for further prediction and avoidance of extreme events.'

title: "Deep learning framework for solving Fokker-Planck equations with low-rank separation representation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: An insightful deep learning framework is proposed to solve the well-known Fokker–Planck (FP) equations that quantify the evolution of the probability density function. It efficiently reduces the demand of training data in acquiring precise integrations of special normalization conditions via neural network (NN). Instead of all hypercubic discrete points, the inputs of each NN only require one-dimensional discrete data, and this also avoids the exponential increase in training data as the dimension increase. Without loss of generality, to solve a $d$-dimensional FP equation, $d$ NNs are employed and assembled into a low-rank separation representation. The FP equation, boundary conditions, and integral operators are then re-expressed in the sense of the separation representation. It enables the constructed loss function to perform simple vector operations, in that complicated $d$-dimensional operators are replaced by a set of one dimensional operators. A tractable strategy is presented for the selection of separation rank inspired by the potential function of the given system, although selecting an appropriate separation rank is still an open issue. Typical numerical examples reveal that the proposed algorithm is effective and superior for solving FP equations. The suggested framework could be applied and extended in various areas of engineering and applied sciences.'

title: "Solving Fokker-Planck equations using deep KD-tree with a small amount of data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: The Fokker–Planck (FP) equation can deterministically describe the evolution of the probability density function, which plays an extremely significant role in the fields of stochastic dynamics. Unfortunately, the limited samples that arise from the consideration of engineering practice are inevitable, which restricts the solving of the FP equation. Accordingly, in the present study, a super-DL-FP framework is established to solve the steady-state FP equation with a small amount of data, through combining the deep KD-tree and the DL-FP approach proposed in [Chaos 30, 013133 (2020)]. It should be emphasized that the normalization condition is of great importance and has to be considered in solving the steady-state FP equation. An appropriate integral estimation for the normalization condition under non-uniform meshing can effectively improve the precision of the solution, but it is still a challenging problem, especially for the case of small data. Thus, the so-called deep KD-tree method is innovatively proposed to estimate the normalized integral with a small random dataset. The main target is to obtain the appropriate discrete integral points and corresponding integral volumes by executing multiple KD-tree segmentation based on random data on the integral region. Several numerical experiments and comparisons are implemented to illustrate the superior performance of the super-DL-FP method. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm can accomplish higher accuracy in the sense of lower cost than the well-known algorithms like center difference scheme, Chebyshev spectrum algorithm, and normalized flow approach.'

title: "Neural network-based parameter estimation of stochastic differential equations driven by Lévy noise"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: In this paper, a novel parameter estimation method based on a two-stage neural network (PENN) is proposed to carry out a joint estimation of a parameterized stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by Lévy noise from a discretely sampled trajectory. The first stage is a long short term memory neural network to extract the compact time-irrelevant deep features from the trajectory. Then a fully connected neural network refines the deep features by integrating the information of time. This neural network architecture allows our method capable of processing trajectories with variable lengths and time spans. Representative SDEs including Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, genetic toggle switch model and bistable Duffing system are presented to determine the effectiveness of our approach. The numerical results suggest that the PENN can simultaneously estimate the parameters of the system and Lévy noise with faster speed and higher accuracy in comparison with traditional estimation methods. Moreover, the method can be easily generalized to different SDEs with flexible settings of sample observation.'

title: "Rate-dependent bifurcation dodging in a thermoacoustic system driven by colored noise"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: Tipping in multistable systems occurs usually by varying the input slightly, resulting in the output switching to an often unsatisfactory state. This phenomenon is manifested in thermoacoustic systems. The thermoacoustic instability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and aeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression. It was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by changing the bifurcation parameters quickly enough, and compared with the white noise discussed in [1], colored noise with nonzero correlation time is more practical and important to the system. Thus, in this work, based on a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored noise, the corresponding Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is derived by using a stochastic averaging method. A transient dynamical behavior is identified through a probability density analysis. We find that both a relatively higher rate of change of parameters and change in the correlation time of the noise are beneficial to dodge thermoacoustic instability, while a relatively large noise intensity is a disadvantageous factor. More interestingly and importantly, power-law relationships between the maximum amplitude and the noise parameters are uncovered, and the probability of successfully dodging a thermoacoustic instability is calculated. These results serve as a guidance for the design of engines and to propose an effective control strategy, which is of great significance to aerospace-related fields.'

title: "Rate-dependent tipping and early warning in a thermoacoustic system under extreme operating environment"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'Abstract: Thermoacoustic instability has been an important challenge in the development of high-performance combustion systems, as it can have catastrophic consequences. The process of a sudden change in the dynamical behavior of a thermoacoustic system from a low- to high-amplitude thermoacoustic instability actually entails as a tipping point phenomenon. It has been found that when rate-dependent parameters are considered, a tipping-delay phenomenon may arise, which helps in the control of undesirable states that give rise to thermoacoustic instabilities. This work aims at understanding rate-dependent tipping dynamics of the thermoacoustic system with both time-varying parameters and a non-Gaussian Lévy noise. The latter better describes the severe operating environment of such systems than simpler types of noise. Through numerical simulations, the tipping dynamical behavior is analyzed by considering the rate-dependent parameters coupled with the main parameters of the Lévy noise, including the stability and skewness indices and the noise intensity. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of early warning indicators in rate-dependent systems under Lévy noise excitation and uncover a relationship between warning measures and the rate of change in the parameters. These results inform and enlighten the development and design of power combustion devices and also provide researchers and engineers with effective ideas to control thermoacoustic instability and the associated tipping dynamics.'

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: Tipping is a phenomenon in multistable systems where small changes in inputs cause huge changes in outputs. When the parameter varies within a certain time scale, the rate will affect the tipping behaviors. These behaviors are undesirable in thermoacoustic systems, which are widely used in aviation, power generation and other industries. Thus, this paper aims at considering the tipping behaviors of the thermoacoustic system with the time-varying parameters and the combined excitations of additive and multiplicative colored noises. Transient dynamical behaviors for the proposed thermoacoustic model are implemented through the reduced Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation derived by a standard stochastic averaging method. Then, the tipping problems of the rate-dependent thermoacoustic systems with random fluctuations are studied by virtue of the obtained probability density functions. Our results show that the rate delays the value of the tipping parameter compared to the one with the quasi-steady assumption, which is called as a rate-dependent tipping-delay phenomenon. Besides, the influences of the initial values, the rate, the changing time of the parameters, and the correlation time of the noises on the rate-dependent tipping-delay phenomenon are analyzed in detail. These results are of great significance for research in related fields such as aviation and land gas turbines.'

title: "Noise-induced alternations and data-driven parameter estimation of a stochastic perceptual model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: Neural systems are inherently noisy and our perceptual system can be then influenced from time to time. In this paper, we considered a perceptual model perturbed by Lévy colored noise, which is much easier to be satisfied in real-world environments than the general Gaussian noise. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the alternation behaviors induced by noise, we characterized the perceptual dynamics in terms of three statistical measures: the mean dominance duration, the number of alternations and the predominance of each interpretation. Numerical simulations showed that the stability index as well as the scale factor and the correlation time of the noise can lead to distinct changes in these measures. Then, attention was paid to data-driven parameter estimation which has typically received less attention than the exploration of stochastic behaviors. A distinctive neural network was proposed to give rise to joint estimates of system parameters and noise parameters, which can also give the measurement to describe the accuracy of estimation. The good performances of our method are shown by simulation tests.'

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: This paper investigates a conceptual pitch–plunge airfoil in hypersonic flows with both structural and aerodynamic nonlinearity, meanwhile the effects of irregular fluctuations in the flow and external random loads modeled as a Gaussian white noise are considered. The dynamic responses of the airfoil model especially the bifurcation behaviors are analyzed via the harmonic balance method for the deterministic case. We found the airfoil system undergo both subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations. Subsequently, the effects of stochasticity on the dynamical behaviors of the hypersonic airfoil system are explored in the regimes of subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations depending on the system parameters. Several interesting phenomena are triggered under random perturbations such as intermittency and stochastic transition between the low-amplitude oscillation state and the undesirable high-amplitude oscillation state. These dynamics are further characterized via the probability density function and time history. This work will provide new insights into the safety and reliability design of hypersonic aircraft.'

title: "Probabilistic description of extreme oscillations and reliability analysis in rolling motion under stochastic excitation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: Large-amplitude rolling motions, also regarded as extreme oscillations, are a great threat to marine navigation, which may lead to capsizing in ship motion. Therefore, it is important to quantify extreme oscillations, assess reliability of ship systems, and establish a suitable indicator to characterize extreme oscillations in ship systems. In this work, extreme events are investigated in a ship model considering a complex ocean environment, described by a single-degree-of-freedom nonlinear system with stochastic harmonic excitation and colored Gaussian noise. The stationary probability density function (PDF) of the system is derived through a probabilistic decomposition-synthesis method. Based on this, we infer the classical damage rate of the system. Furthermore, a new indicator, independent of the PDF, is proposed to quantify the damage related only to the fourth-order moment of the system and the threshold for extreme events. It is more universal and easier to determine as compared with the classical damage rate. A large damping ratio, a large noise intensity, or a short correlation time can reduce the damage rate and the value of the indicator. These findings provide new insights and theoretical guidance to avoid extreme oscillations and assess the reliability of practical ship movements.'

title: "Extreme events in a class of nonlinear Duffing-type oscillators with a parametric periodic force"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-02-paper-title-number-10
excerpt: 'Abstract: Extreme events happen when a system is far from the expectation and normal region, which are common in many practical problems, such as climate and engineering systems. It will affect the accuracy and damage the reliability, or even lead to a collapse of the system. In this work, extreme events are studied in a class of generalized nonlinear Duffing-type oscillators with a parametric periodic force. The occurrence mechanism, description methods and risk of extreme events are discussed. We find that the tail probability of the state response is large when extreme events occur frequently. This indicates that the dynamic structure enables the system to reach a rather far position, for which the varying of the potential function provides a possible underlying explanation for this phenomenon. In addition, the effects of the amplitude and the frequency are investigated to quantify the extreme events. With the metrics of inter-event interval (IEI), mean of IEI, survival probability function, and hazard rate function, the risk of extreme events is characterized. The obtained results not only quantitatively give the characteristics of extreme events in a class of generalized Duffing-type oscillators, but also assess the risk of extreme events, which can provide theoretical guidance for the design and fabrication of micro-electromechanical components.'

excerpt: 'Abstract: The probability density function of stochastic differential equations is governed by the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. A novel machine learning method is developed to solve the general FP equations based on deep neural networks. The proposed algorithm does not require any interpolation and coordinate transformation, which is different from the traditional numerical methods. The main novelty of this paper is that penalty factors are introduced to overcome the local optimization for the deep learning approach, and the corresponding setting rules are given. Meanwhile, we consider a normalization condition as a supervision condition to effectively avoid that the trial solution is zero. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate performances of the proposed algorithm, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems. All the results suggest that the deep learning is quite feasible and effective to calculate the FP equation. Furthermore, influences of the number of hidden layers, the penalty factors, and the optimization algorithm are discussed in detail. These results indicate that the performances of the machine learning technique can be improved through constructing the neural networks appropriately.'

To analyze the reliability, the effects of stochasticity on the dynamic behaviors of the hypersonic airfoil model are discussed in detail. Several unwanted phenomena that result in the failure of the airfoil structure are induced by random fluctuations. Subsequently, the reliability of the airfoil model is defined and analyzed according to the first passage failure criteria. The effects of different parameters on the reliability are investigated. Furthermore, a nonlinear energy sink is introduced to suppress the vibration of the airfoil and enhance the reliability. Two-dimensional reliability regions of the airfoil model are given to provide the safety parameter region. The results show that the reliability of the airfoil model is significantly improved with the nonlinear energy sink.
