excerpt: 'Abstract: The reliability of a pitch-plunge hypersonic airfoil in random fluctuating flow with both cubic and freeplay nonlinearity is examined. The Hopf bifurcation and dynamic responses of the hypersonic airfoil are performed. To analyze the reliability, the effects of stochasticity on the dynamic behaviors of the hypersonic airfoil model are discussed in detail. Several unwanted phenomena that result in the failure of the airfoil structure are induced by random fluctuations. Subsequently, the reliability of the airfoil model is defined and analyzed according to the first passage failure criteria. The effects of different parameters on the reliability are investigated. Furthermore, a nonlinear energy sink is introduced to suppress the vibration of the airfoil and enhance the reliability. Two-dimensional reliability regions of the airfoil model are given to provide the safety parameter region. The results show that the reliability of the airfoil model is significantly improved with the nonlinear energy sink. This work will provide new insights into the safety design of hypersonic aircraft.'
