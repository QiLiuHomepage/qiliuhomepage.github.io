excerpt: 'Abstract: In this paper, we investigate nonlinear dynamical responses of two-degree-of-freedom airfoil (TDOFA) models driven by harmonic excitation under uncertain disturbance. Firstly, based on the deterministic airfoil models under the harmonic excitation, we introduce stochastic TDOFA models with the uncertain disturbance as Gaussian white noise. Subsequently, we consider the amplitude-frequency characteristic of deterministic airfoil models by the averaging method, and also the stochastic averaging method is applied to obtain the mean-square response of given stochastic TDOFA systems analytically. Then, we carry out numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the obtained analytic solution and the influence of harmonic force on the system response is studied. Finally, stochastic jump and bifurcation can be found through the random responses of system, and probability density function and time history diagrams can be obtained via Monte Carlo simulations directly to observe the stochastic jump and bifurcation. The results show that noise can induce the occurrence of stochastic jump and bifurcation, which will have a significant impact on the safety of aircraft.'
